        Take My Love, Take my Land, take me where I cannot stand.  I don't care, I'm still free, you can't take the sky from me!
        Take me out, to the black, tell maw maw I ain't coming back.  Burn the land and Boil the sea, you can't take the sky from me!
        There's no place I can be, since I found Serenity.  You can't take the sky from me!
